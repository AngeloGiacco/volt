# volt
I am founding a charity, volt. 
It will fundraise for Indonesian farmers that usually earn less than $2 a day.
Money fundraised in the UK will be used to provide the farmers with a low cost 
solution for agrivoltaic production: when land is used for crops and solar energy production. 
This not only has the advantage of doubling the revenue for the farmer, but also brings to electricity to some
of the most remote parts of Indonesia. My friend Vijjasena is currently testing the solution 
he has developed and he will be responsible for spending the funds raised for volt.

Meeting on Friday
